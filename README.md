Force-Directed Graph: Highlights the recovery rate.

Treemap: Illustrates total prevalence excluding HIV-related cases.

Sunburst Chart: Breaks down total cases into hierarchical segments.

Filters

Region Filter: Narrow down the analysis to specific regions.

Year Filter: Focus on data for a specific year or range of years.

Interactivity

Tooltips: Hover over visual elements to see detailed information.

Region Selection: Click on regions in the visualizations or legend for focused analysis.
