# Global-Tuberculosis-Analysis-using-D3

## Overview
The Global Tuberculosis Analysis Dashboard is an interactive visualization tool that provides insights into Tuberculosis data from 1990 to 2013. This dashboard enables users to analyze key metrics such as incidence, recovery rate, prevalence, and total cases across different regions and years.

## Features

### Visualizations
The dashboard includes the following five visualizations:
1. Timeline Visualization: Displays total incidence, recovery rate, and total prevalence over time.
2. Map Chart: Shows the total number of Tuberculosis cases geographically.
3. Force-Directed Graph: Highlights the recovery rate.
4. Treemap: Illustrates total prevalence excluding HIV-related cases.
5. Sunburst Chart: Breaks down total cases into hierarchical segments.

### Filters
> Region Filter: Narrow down the analysis to specific regions.
> Year Filter: Focus on data for a specific year or range of years.

### Interactivity
1. Tooltips: Hover over visual elements to see detailed information.
2. Region Selection: Click on regions in the visualizations or legend for focused analysis.
3. Legend: Interactive legend allows selecting regions directly.
4. Zoom In/Out: "+" icon in the top right corner expands a specific visualization to full screen, and "x" icon in the bottom right corner restores it to its original size.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project files to your local system.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Run the dashboard by opening the Dashboard.html file with a live server (e.g., Visual Studio Codeâ€™s Live Server extension).

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the dashboard in your browser.
2. Use the Region Filter and Year Filter to refine the data shown in the visualizations.
3. Hover over data points to view detailed tooltips.
4. Click on regions within the visualizations or the legend for specific region analysis.
5. Use the "+" icon in the top right corner to expand a visualization for a detailed view. Use the "x" icon in the bottom right corner to zoom back out.

Technologies Used
> HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For creating and styling the dashboard.
> D3.js: For rendering interactive and dynamic visualizations.
> Live Server: To host the project locally.

Known Issues
> Ensure the live server is running to interact with the dashboard.
> Larger datasets may take longer to load on slower machines.

Future Enhancements
> Add support for additional filters (e.g., gender or age group).
> Include predictive analytics for Tuberculosis trends beyond 2013.
> Export functionality for filtered data.
